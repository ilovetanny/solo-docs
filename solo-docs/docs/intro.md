# tutorial intro

let's discover **solo explorer in less than 5 minutes**.

## getting started

get started by **connecting a wallet**.

or **try solo immediately** without connecting **[soloexplorer.xyz](https://soloexplorer.xyz)**.

### what you'll need

- a pubkey, token address, or transaction signature id

## generate a new search

generate a new solo search using the **search bar**.

the search bar will automatically determine the type of ata and navigate you to the most relevant data. 

view token holdings with price, organized in a pie graph for ease of viewing

with a wallet connected, leave comments and view them all in one place. each comment navigates you to the original.

## start your journey

begin keeping closer track of your transactions, locked and staked tokens, or accounts you may leave behind. solo explorer allows users to take close account of their activities on solana. 

your comments are logged with your pubkey, so solo works on devnet. no signatures for transactions are ever required.

! BEAR IN MIND !

the database for comments is on firebase/firestore. for this reason, solo is not intended for sensitive data like private keys, seedphrases, or passwords.
